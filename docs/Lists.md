# Lists
The lists page is where you can create and manage your ranked lists of games. 
When you create a list, the games that have not been trashed or filtered out 
will be added to the pool of games that you will rank. You can refine this to some 
extent after you have made the list, but it's best to do the bulk of your filtering 
in the game library prior to creating your list.

You can create, edit/open, rename and delete lists. For details on editing a list, see below.
