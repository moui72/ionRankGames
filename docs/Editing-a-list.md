Once you have opened a list, you can start to rank your games by making comparisons. 
You can also browse both the ranked and unranked sets of games and make corrections via 
drag-and-drop. Below you will find some explanation for some of the commands you'll find 
while editing a list.

# Global commands
The commands on the main menu are not tied to a specific game.

## Reset
The reset button will unrank all games (*[unrank](#Unrank_game_92)* is defined below).

## Save to file
The save to file button will download your list as a `.json` file. You should use this to 
back-up your list/

## Load from file
*Not yet implemented.* The load from file button allows you to import a list from a previously
downloaded `.json` file.

## Copy &amp; Paste
The copy &amp; paste button will display your list in a copy &amp; paste friendly format. You 
can choose from HTML, plain text, or BGG forum code. You can also choose to display them in
ascending or descending order.

# More
Clicking on an unranked game or clicking the "more" button will make the following commands
visible.

## Unrank game
Ranked games will have an &times; button to their right. This button will unrank that game.
Unranking a game will remove it from the ranked list and return it to the 
unranked (soon-to-be-ranked) set.

## Trash game
Dropping a game will remove it from the set of games accessible from this list.
It will not trash it in your library, so it will appear in future lists if you
don't trash it manually or filter it out subsequently.

## Set to #1
This will straightforwardly prepend a game to your ranked list. You will never be prompted 
to compare a game prepended in this way to other ranked games, only unranked ones, so be careful.

## Set to #X
The value of X will vary; this button will append a game to the end of your ranked list. 
You will never be prompted to compare a game appended in this way to other ranked games, 
only unranked ones, so be careful.
