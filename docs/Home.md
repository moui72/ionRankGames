This app is intended to help you build ranked lists of games from those in your collection
on [Board Game Geek](http://boardgamegeek.com). Built using Typescript, Angular 2 and Ionic 2. Access the live app at [rankgames.ty-pe.com](http://rankgames.ty-pe.com).

# System requirements and limitations
This app currently only supports Chrome 52+ on desktop or laptop computers.
It may not function and may perform poorly on mobile devices and in other browsers.

# Feedback
I welcome any and all feedback. Please use one of the following methods to contact me: [geekmail moui](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmail/compose?touser=moui), reply to [my forum thread](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/23452478), or create an issue on the [rankgames github repo](https://github.com/moui72/rankGames/issues).

This app stores your data locally, so you may want to periodically back up your work using the import/export functionality. If you ever "clear all data" in your browser, you will lose everything.
