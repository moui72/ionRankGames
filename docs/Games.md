The games page is where you set up the pool of games that you will build
your ranked lists from. It offers two views, accessible via the "games"
and "trashed games" tabs at the bottom of the screen. The "games" are
those that will be available when you make a list. The "trashed games"
are those that you have trashed individually, or removed via a filter.

You can indivually remove games from or restore games to the pool of
games that will be available for ranking from these views.

# Games menu commands
The games page also has a menu of commands available. The menu can be
opened using the menu icon at the top left.

## Purge
The purge command will delete all games that you have imported, whether
they have been filtered, trashed or remain in the general pool. This
command is irreversible. You will be prompted to confirm before it
actually executes.

## Fetch
The fetch command will import all games in a given boardgamegeek user's
collection. Once they've been imported you will be able to manipulate
which ones are actually available during the ranking process.

## Filter
The filter command will categorically remove games from the available
pool. You can then individually correct any exceptions using the "trash"
or "restore" button for a given game.

## Download
Download your game libary to a `.json` file. You should use this to back up your data when
appropriate because if you ever "clear all data" in your browser, the app will forget what
you've done.

## Upload
Restore data from a previously downloaded `.json` file.
