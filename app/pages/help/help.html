    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
    <p>This app is intended to help you build ranked lists of games from those in your
    collection on <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com">Board Game Geek</a>. It&#39;s open source:
    check it out on <a href="https://github.com/moui72/rankGames/">github</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="system-requirements-and-limitations">System requirements and limitations</h3>
    <p>This app currently only supports Chrome 52+ on desktop or laptop computers.
    It may not function and may perform poorly on mobile devices and in other
    browsers.</p>
    <h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
    <p>I welcome any and all feedback. Please use one of the following methods to
    contact me:
    <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmail/compose?touser=moui">geekmail moui</a>,
    reply to <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/23452478">my forum thread</a>,
    or create an issue on the
    <a href="https://github.com/moui72/rankGames/issues">rankgames github repo</a>.</p>
    <p>This app stores your data locally, so you may want to periodically back up your
    work using the import/export functionality. If you ever &quot;clear all data&quot; in
    your browser, you will lose everything.</p>
    <h2 id="games">Games</h2>
    <p>The games page is where you set up the pool of games that you will build your
    ranked lists from. It offers two views, accessible via the &quot;games&quot; and
    &quot;trashed games&quot; tabs at the bottom of the screen. The &quot;games&quot; are those that
    will be available when you make a list. The &quot;trashed games&quot; are those that you
    have trashed individually, or removed via a filter.</p>
    <p>You can indivually remove games from or restore games to the pool of
    games that will be available for ranking from these views.</p>
    <h3 id="menu-commands">Menu commands</h3>
    <p>The games page also has a menu of commands available. The menu can be opened
    using the menu icon at the top left.</p>
    <h4 id="purge">Purge</h4>
    <p>The purge command will delete all games that you have imported, whether
    they have been filtered, trashed or remain in the general pool. This
    command is irreversible. You will be prompted to confirm before it
    actually executes.</p>
    <h4 id="fetch">Fetch</h4>
    <p>The fetch command will import all games in a given boardgamegeek user&#39;s
    collection. Once they&#39;ve been imported you will be able to manipulate
    which ones are actually available during the ranking process.</p>
    <h4 id="filter">Filter</h4>
    <p>The filter command will categorically remove games from the available pool. You
    can then individually correct any exceptions using the &quot;trash&quot; or &quot;restore&quot;
    button for a given game.</p>
    <h4 id="download">Download</h4>
    <p>Download your game libary to a <code>.json</code> file. You should use this to back up
    your data when appropriate because if you ever &quot;clear all data&quot; in your
    browser, the app will forget what you&#39;ve done.</p>
    <h4 id="upload">Upload</h4>
    <p>Restore data from a previously downloaded <code>.json</code> file.</p>
    <h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
    <p>The lists page is where you can create and manage your ranked lists of games.
    When you create a list, the games that have not been trashed or filtered out
    will be added to the pool of games that you will rank. You can refine this to
    some extent after you have made the list, but it&#39;s best to do the bulk of your
    filtering in the game library prior to creating your list.</p>
    <p>You can create, edit/open, rename and delete lists. For details on editing a
    list, see below.</p>
    <h2 id="editing-a-list">Editing a list</h2>
    <p>Once you have opened a list, you can start to rank your games by making
    comparisons. You can also browse both the ranked and unranked sets of games and
    make corrections via drag-and-drop. Below you will find some explanation for
    some of the commands you&#39;ll find while editing a list.</p>
    <h3 id="global-commands">Global commands</h3>
    <p>The commands on the main menu are not tied to a specific game.</p>
    <h4 id="reset">Reset</h4>
    <p>The reset button will unrank all games (<em>unrank</em> is defined below).</p>
    <h4 id="save-to-file">Save to file</h4>
    <p>The save to file button will download your list as a <code>.json</code> file. You should
    use this to back-up your list.</p>
    <h4 id="load-from-file">Load from file</h4>
    <p><em>Not yet implemented.</em> The load from file button allows you to import a list
    from a previously downloaded <code>.json</code> file.</p>
    <h4 id="copy-amp-paste">Copy &amp; Paste</h4>
    <p>The copy &amp; paste button will display your list in a copy &amp; paste
    friendly format. You can choose from HTML, plain text, or BGG forum code.
    You can also choose to display them in ascending or descending order.</p>
    <h3 id="more">More</h3>
    <p>Clicking on an unranked game or clicking the &quot;more&quot; button will make the
    following commands visible.</p>
    <h4 id="unrank-game">Unrank game</h4>
    <p>Ranked games will have an &times; button to their right. This button will
    unrank that game. Unranking a game will remove it from the ranked list and
    return it to the unranked (soon-to-be-ranked) set.</p>
    <h4 id="trash-game">Trash game</h4>
    <p>Dropping a game will remove it from the set of games accessible from this list.
    It will not trash it in your library, so it will appear in future lists if you
    don&#39;t trash it manually or filter it out subsequently.</p>
    <h4 id="set-to-1">Set to #1</h4>
    <p>This will straightforwardly prepend a game to your ranked list. You will never
    be prompted to compare a game prepended in this way to other ranked games,
    only unranked ones, so be careful.</p>
    <h4 id="set-to-x">Set to #X</h4>
    <p>The value of X will vary; this button will append a game to the end of your
    ranked list. You will never be prompted to compare a game appended in this way
    to other ranked games, only unranked ones, so be careful.</p>
