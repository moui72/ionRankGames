    <h1><ion-icon name="home"></ion-icon> Games</h1>
    <p>
      The games page is where you set up the pool of games that you will build
      your ranked lists from. It offers two views, accessible via the "games" and
      "trashed games" tabs at the bottom of the screen. The "games" are those
      that will be available when you make a list. The "trashed games" are those
      that you have trashed individually, or removed via a filter.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can indivually remove games from or restore games to the pool of games that will be available for ranking from these views.
    </p>
    <div padding>
      <h2><ion-icon name="menu"></ion-icon> Menu commands</h2>
      <p>
        The games page also has a menu of commands available. The menu can be opened using the <ion-icon name="menu"></ion-icon> menu icon at the top left.
      </p>
      <div padding>
        <h3>
          <ion-icon danger name="warning"></ion-icon>
          Purge
        </h3>
        <p>
          The purge command will delete all games that you have imported, whether
          they have been filtered, trashed or remain in the general pool. This
          command is irreversible. You will be prompted to confirm before it actually
          executes.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <ion-icon name="sync"></ion-icon>
          Fetch
        </h3>
        <p>
          The fetch command will import all games in a given boardgamegeek user's
          collection. Once they've been imported you will be able to manipulate which
          ones are actually available during the ranking process.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <ion-icon name="funnel"></ion-icon>
          Filter
        </h3>
        <p>
          The filter command will categorically remove games from the available pool.
          You can then individually correct any exceptions using the "trash"
          or "restore" button for a given game.
